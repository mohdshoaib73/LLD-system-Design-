# Introduction to LLD(Low Level Design) System Design

####  What is LLD?
LLD is a blueprint that helps to the developer, how to implement specific feature or component in s/w system.
This achieve using different concept such as CLASSES,METHOD, ALGO & DATA STRUCTURE.

There is following phase involve in it...

#### Requirement Analysis
#### Design
#### Implementation
#### Testing
#### Deployement
#### further updated version

### LLD mainly focusing on these three...
#### Scalability
                ->It focuses on ensuring that the application can sustain all condition such as handling 
                million of concurrent user requests.
#### Maintainability
                ->It ensure that application can be easily debug & updated.
                ->Good code structure reduce the future development cost and easy to maintain.
 #### Reusability       
                -> It means using same code,method or component in diffrent application without rewriting.
                -> Code should not tightly coupled(independ to other module).
                ->Example---if we developed the notification component once, we can use it again & again(Plug & Play model).         
                            Using common utility functions,Creating generic classes & Applying OOP principles like inheritance and composition
