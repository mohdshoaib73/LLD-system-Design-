### Why we need OOPs?
1.it's use to real world modeling while procedural lang can not do this.
2.It provide data security while Procedural Programming not provide.
3.It is use to build highly scalable and reusable applictaion while Procedural Programming not provide this function.

## Class
Class is the blueprint of the real world entity it defines a entity behavior(Member Functions ()) and its Chararcteristics(Data Member).
class do not require any memory.
##### Syntax
       class Class_Name{
        //Acess modifier of class
        Data Members;
        Member Functions;
        
       };
## Object
Object is the instance of the class that needs memory.
exmaple--building a system using class blueprint with the obj.

## Pillar of OOPs

## Abstraction
## Encapsulation
## Polymorphism
## Inheritance
